Today, I built an automated ticket generator that uses GPT-4o to generate Jira tickets from a given requirements file. It uses Python, OpenAI API and takes in a requirements file, splits it into suitable PRs and generates a Jira ticket for each PR.

Add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` to the `.env` and you're good to go.

- uv venv
- source .venv/bin/activate
- uv pip install -r requirements.txt
- uv run app.py --file requirements.md --non-interactive
